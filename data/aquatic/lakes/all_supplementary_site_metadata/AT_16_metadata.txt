DO and water temperature data was collected by AJ Ulseth using HOBO DO loggers at 5-min intervals. DO loggers were downloaded and maintained monthly and corrected for potential drift by 'bubbling' the sondes with 100% saturated water stream-side before and after each download/maintenance round.
Air pressure was collected at the weather station in the centre of the Ybbs River Network (YRN), and then corrected for elevation at each site.
DOsat was calculated based on site specific barometric pressure and water temp with equations from Garcia and Gordon 1992 L&O.
Light (lux) was collected using HOBO light and temperature pendants deployed stream-side.
Depth was calculated based on scaling relationships specific for the YRN (Ceola et al. 2014).
Discharge was calculated from downstream gauges and corrected for catchment size.
This oxygen and associated data was used to estimate GPP and ER as published in Ulseth et al. Ecosystems 2018.
