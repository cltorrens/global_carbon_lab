         Two and a half decades of limnological data have been collected from nearly 400 lakes, encompassing a wide range of systems and a broad range of geography. This data set comprises one of the largest and most complete sets of measurements of underwater ultraviolet (UV) transparency available in the world. The data include a suite of 36 variables, with a focus on the optical characteristics. Lakes range from pristine natural lakes to manmade reservoirs. The systems represented in this data set are largely located in North America, from the northeastern United States to Alaska, and alpine and subalpine lakes in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. Lakes included range from iconic Lake Tahoe, and Castle Lake in northern California, to lakes in the South American Patagonian region, as well as New Zealand. Data were most often collected during the summer, and in some lakes span multiple years (with year-round data since 2006 in Lake Tahoe). The data here are contained in four files, including LakeData.csv, SiteInformation.csv, Methods.csv, and Variables.csv. The main data are in LakeData.csv. SiteInformation.csv, Methods.csv, and Variables.csv support the main data file with descriptions of the sampling sites, methods by which samples were processed, and descriptions of the variables that were measured, respectively.
         This data set complements the site-intensive limnological data that we published in EDI on 30+ years of data from 3 lakes in the Poconos Mountains region of Pennsylvania, USA. This complementary data set can be accessed at https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=186

         We acknowledge the assistance of many colleagues and students who helped collect, compile, and make these data available. While too many people have been involved at too many levels to enable mentioning all of the names, some key people whom we acknowledge for their help in actually collecting, or assisting and enabling the collection of the data include Kevin Rose for many of the lakes across the Americas and New Zealand, Jasmine Saros for the Beartooth Mountain lakes, Glacier National Park, Greenland, and Maine lakes, Janet Fischer and Mark Olson for the Canadian Rocky Mountain lakes, Geoff Schladow, Brant Allen, and Andrew Tucker for Lake Tahoe, Don Morris and Diane McKnight for the Colorado lakes, Jordan Read for the Wisconsin lakes, Esteban Balsiero and Horacio Zagarese for the Argentinean lakes, Horacio Zagarese and John Hobbie for the lakes in northern Alaska, Olaf Olson, Dan Engstrom, Nathan Walker, and Sheri Fritz for the lakes in southern Alaska, Carolyn Burns, and Evan and Trevor Williamson for the New Zealand lakes, John Melack and Steven Sadro for the Sierra Nevada lakes, Wiebke Boing for the New Mexico sinkholes, Sudeep Chandra for Castle Lake, Meghan Duffy and Spencer Hall for the lakes in Michigan and Indiana, Mike Vanni and Maria Gonzalez for the Ohio reservoirs, and Hilary Swain for Lake Annie in Florida. Erin Overholt and Beth Mette, with guidance from Eric Johnson at Miami University, created the ultimate database structure, compiled all of the data, and posted the database on EDI.

               Since 1994, limnological data have been collected on a large number of lakes, with a focus on vertical profiles of temperature, UV radiation, PAR, and associated optical properties. While some lakes were sampled in a single year, others have been sampled multiple times over this period, primarily during the ice-free season, though in a few cases sampling is year-round or throughout the ice-free season. Data were collected during daylight hours, and generally within a few hours of midday. Many variables were measured at multiple depths throughout the water column with profiling instruments or interval samplers. With this large of a data set, methods and instruments have necessarily varied over this 25+ year time period. We have associated the appropriate methods used for each data point in this data set using a MethodID, denoted in the main data table, LakeData.csv. These MethodIDs are associated with the Methods.csv file, in which specific methods used for sample collection and analysis are described.

               UpperDepth
               Together UpperDepth and LowerDepth define the depth at which the sample was collected. If equal to equal to each other, the sample was taken at a discrete depth, with these depth values being the depth below the surface of the water from which the sample was collect. If the sample was collected by pooling water from a portion of the water colum UpperDepth will define the upper limit of that column and LowerDepth the lower limit. For example, if a water sample was integrated through the top 3 meters of the water column, UpperDepth would be 0 and LowerDepth 3. NA is reported for measurements that do not have an associated depth, and a value of -1 is reported for measurements taken above the surface of the water.
